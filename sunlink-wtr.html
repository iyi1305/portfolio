            <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
            <p>During my co-op term at Sunlink Energies, I worked as an IT Intern supporting both infrastructure and
                end-user services. My responsibilities spanned troubleshooting systems, managing technical
                documentation, and contributing to digital solutions that supported the company’s operations. This
                experience allowed me to apply technical knowledge in a professional energy-sector environment,
                strengthening both my problem-solving and teamwork skills.</p>

            <h2>Information About the Employer</h2>
            <p>Sunlink Energies is a renewable energy company focused on providing sustainable power solutions,
                including solar and clean energy systems. With operations supporting both residential and industrial
                clients, Sunlink is committed to advancing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. As part
                of the IT team, I contributed to the technical backbone that supports their business operations and
                customer services.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Proficiency:</strong> Gain practical experience with IT troubleshooting, systems
                    support, and documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Apply analytical skills to diagnose and resolve technical issues
                    effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work closely with other IT staff to support users and ensure system

            <p><strong>Reflection on Goals:</strong> I achieved greater confidence in resolving technical issues and
                improved my ability to communicate solutions clearly. While I made progress in documentation and
                teamwork, I identified a need to deepen my skills in network administration, which I plan to pursue in
                future roles.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As an IT Intern, my responsibilities involved both day-to-day support and project-based tasks that kept
                Sunlink’s IT systems running smoothly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Support:</strong> Assisted staff with troubleshooting software and hardware
                    issues.</li>
                <li><strong>System Maintenance:</strong> Helped monitor and update systems to ensure reliability and
                    security.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Drafted and updated IT process guides to support knowledge sharing
                    across the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Worked with IT colleagues to improve response time and efficiency in
                    handling user requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Projects/Experiences</h2>
            <h3>1. Troubleshooting and User Support</h3>
            <p>Provided first-line technical support, helping employees resolve hardware and software challenges. This
                role sharpened my diagnostic skills and my ability to explain technical fixes in simple terms to
                non-technical colleagues.</p>

            <h3>2. IT Documentation</h3>
            <p>Contributed to the creation of IT support documentation, including step-by-step guides for common
                troubleshooting processes. This reduced repetitive queries and empowered staff to solve smaller issues
                independently.</p>

            <h3>3. Systems Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Assisted in monitoring system performance and ensuring timely updates. This experience deepened my
                understanding of IT infrastructure in a corporate environment.</p>

                <li>Improved troubleshooting and technical support skills.</li>
                <li>Experience in IT documentation and knowledge-sharing practices.</li>
                <li>Strengthened collaboration and workplace communication skills.</li>

            <h2>Reflections and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This internship reinforced the importance of IT as the foundation of modern business operations. I
                learned how to translate classroom knowledge into practical solutions and how to support users
                effectively. My experience also highlighted areas for further growth, particularly in network and
                systems administration, which I intend to pursue in future opportunities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

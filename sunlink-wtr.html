            <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
            <p>During my co-op term at Sunlink Energies, I worked as an IT Intern supporting both infrastructure and
                end-user services. My responsibilities spanned troubleshooting systems, managing technical
                documentation, and contributing to digital solutions that supported the company’s operations. This
                experience allowed me to apply technical knowledge in a professional oil and gas environment,
                strengthening my problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork skills while also giving me exposure to
                compliance and governance tools such as Microsoft Purview.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Information About the Employer</h2>
            <p>Sunlink Energies is one of the first truly independent indigenous oil and gas exploration and production
                companies in Nigeria. Founded in 1986 by Dr. Olaniyi Olumide, the company has established itself as a
                leading African independent operator by leveraging expertise and indigenous know-how. </p>
            <p><strong>Vision:</strong> “We enrich lives by providing innovative and sustainable energy solutions.”</p>
            <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To profitably invest in, acquire, develop, or manage diverse energy assets in a
                sustainable manner; to leverage expertise and indigenous knowledge to create value; to participate in
                various areas of the energy value chain; to invest in the wellbeing of employees; and to continually
                adapt as a learning organization.</p>
            <p>As part of the IT team, I supported the technology backbone that enables Sunlink to manage operations
                effectively, collaborate across teams, and maintain the secure systems required in the high-stakes oil
                and gas industry.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Proficiency:</strong> Gain practical experience with IT troubleshooting, systems
                    support, and documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Apply analytical skills to diagnose and resolve technical issues
                    effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work closely with other IT staff to support users and ensure system
                    reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Development:</strong> Strengthen workplace communication and adaptability in a
                    professional environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reflection on Goals:</strong> I achieved greater confidence in resolving technical issues and
                improved my ability to communicate solutions clearly. While I made progress in documentation and
                teamwork, I identified a need to deepen my skills in network administration and enterprise compliance
                tools, which I plan to pursue in future roles.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>As an IT Intern, my responsibilities involved both day-to-day support and project-based tasks that kept
                Sunlink’s IT systems running smoothly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Support:</strong> Assisted staff with troubleshooting software and hardware
                    issues.</li>
                <li><strong>System Maintenance:</strong> Helped monitor and update systems to ensure reliability and
                    security.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Drafted and updated IT process guides to support knowledge sharing
                    across the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Worked with IT colleagues to improve response time and efficiency in
                    handling user requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Projects/Experiences</h2>
            <h3>1. Troubleshooting and User Support</h3>
            <p>Provided first-line technical support, helping employees resolve hardware and software challenges. This
                role sharpened my diagnostic skills and my ability to explain technical fixes in simple terms to
                non-technical colleagues.</p>

            <h3>2. IT Documentation</h3>
            <p>Contributed to the creation of IT support documentation, including step-by-step guides for common
                troubleshooting processes. This reduced repetitive queries and empowered staff to solve smaller issues
                independently.</p>

            <h3>3. Systems Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Assisted in monitoring system performance and ensuring timely updates. This experience deepened my
                understanding of IT infrastructure in a corporate environment.</p>

            <h3>4. Microsoft Purview Exploration</h3>
            <p>Researched Microsoft Purview, a compliance and data governance tool, and prepared a demo presentation for
                my supervisor. This gave me valuable exposure to data governance and retention policies, which are
                becoming increasingly important in industries like oil and gas.</p>

                <li>Improved troubleshooting and technical support skills.</li>
                <li>Experience in IT documentation and knowledge-sharing practices.</li>
                <li>Strengthened collaboration and workplace communication skills.</li>
                <li>Understanding of IT infrastructure and systems monitoring in an energy-sector company.</li>
                <li>Initial exposure to compliance and governance tools such as Microsoft Purview.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reflections and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This internship reinforced the importance of IT as the foundation of modern business operations,
                particularly in a high-stakes industry like oil and gas where secure and reliable systems are essential.
                I learned how to translate classroom knowledge into practical solutions and how to support users
                effectively. My experience also highlighted areas for further growth, particularly in network and
                systems administration, as well as enterprise data governance. I intend to continue developing in these
                areas in future opportunities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>I would like to thank my supervisor and the IT team at Sunlink Energies for their mentorship and guidance
                throughout my co-op term. Their support gave me valuable industry exposure and practical skills that I
                will carry into future roles.</p>

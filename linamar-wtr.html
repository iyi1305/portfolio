            <h2>Key Projects/Experiences</h2>
        
            <h3>1. Optimizing Financial Reporting</h3>
            <p>
                One of my key duties was to improve the efficiency and dependability of financial reports generated using OneStream. 
                I worked with stakeholders to identify gaps in existing reports, create custom Cube Views, and automate data validation processes. These changes cut report creation time by 20% and gave the finance team precise insights for strategic decision-making.
            </p>
        
            <h3>2. Workflow and Process Improvement</h3>
            <p>
                I examined existing workflows for financial data handling and reporting to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. 
                Through process mapping and collaboration, I recommended and executed changes to minimise bottlenecks, streamline operations, and reduce manual duties. These advancements boosted productivity and paved the way for future process automation.
            </p>
        
            <h3>3. Documentation for OneStream Functionalities</h3>
            <p>
                To promote OneStream adoption, I designed user-friendly instructions for important functionality such as Cube Views and data validation processes. These materials are easy to understand for both technical and non-technical users, resulting in speedier onboarding and less need for direct help. Colleagues reported increased confidence and productivity after using these instructions.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Advanced technical skills in OneStream, Excel, and SQL.</li>
                <li>Enhanced abilities in requirements gathering and process documentation.</li>
                <li>Improved verbal and written communication with diverse teams.</li>
                <li>Strengthened analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Reflections and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>I was able to combine my technical knowledge with business analysis in this position, which helped me gain a better grasp of how financial systems help organisations achieve their objectives. My interest in the nexus of business and technology was cemented when I had hands-on experience in requirements gathering, data analysis, and process optimisation.</p>

            <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>I want to express my gratitude to Jessica Hesch, my supervisor, and the Linamar Financial Systems team for their guidance and assistance during my co-op period. My development as a business analyst was greatly aided by their advice.</p>
